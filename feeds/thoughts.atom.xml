I’ve been interested in Computing and Electronics since I was a young lad. I’ve been working from home for the past 2.5 years for a company called Appen. On top of that I’ve got 5+ years working experience within the Software Development and Hardware (makers) fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python, Oh Python&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programming language I’m most familiar with is python (although I do use several other languages, this is what I use on a day-to-day basis). I love its flexibility, ‘batteries-included’ attitude and its vibrant and awesome community. The real power of python is in the additional libraries that have been created to handle a myriad of tasks. What am I familiar with other than the standard library; flask, requests, selenium, numpy, scipy, pandas, pyexcel, scrapy, pelican to name a few. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making a Move&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from home can and is challenging at times; and requires you to keep on top of the tasks you are currently attending to. It also provides you with a great deal of flexibility to pursue other tasks and activities whilst maintaining a full-time working schedule. I’ve not considered freelancing until recently – but due to the amount of extra time I have on a daily basis it seems a great fit with my current situation and &lt;a href="https://www.toptal.com/web"&gt;Toptal&lt;/a&gt; has some of the best resources and services when it comes to my needs – the partners and associates working with you guys is impressive. Other aspects that are also extremely positive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resources and posts within your blog are great – I’ve just finished reading &lt;a href="https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/tensorflow-python-tutorial"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Which was fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your 3% philosophy – working with the best is something that I enjoy as well as thrive on. Having people challenge you to do better is a great motivation for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your industry presence and stature – you guys are major player in the Freelance industry and have a substantial amount of skilled people working for you and with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Toptal+++&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that challenging projects are usually the most rewarding and fun! I’ve done my research and have found a lot of your competitors are providing short term, no frills contracts, that are generally very task driven and aren’t extremely original – these are fine and will pay the bills; but I want to get my teeth stuck into something more complex and interesting, something I believe &lt;a href="https://www.toptal.com/web"&gt;Toptal&lt;/a&gt; provides. &lt;a href="https://www.toptal.com/web"&gt;Toptal&lt;/a&gt;’s different Web developers Network's provide you with a wealth of experience and knowledge that I hope to tap into. The python Web developers Network you have is a great resource. &lt;a href="https://www.toptal.com/python"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
